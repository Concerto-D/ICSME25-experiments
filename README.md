# Results for ICSME 2025

## Experimental scrips

The experiments presented in `Managing Conflicts in Cross-DevOps Declarative Reconfigurations`, submitted at [ICSME 2025](https://conf.researchr.org/home/icsme-2025) 
have been run using the two following scripts : `g5k_topological.py` and `g5k_openstack.py`.

## Experimental results

All cases described in the submitted papers have been tested, and computation times have been recorded. 
In this current repositoy, each directory corresponds to one case described in the submitted article.
In each directory, a subdirectory presents merged results, for satisfiable and unsatisfiable scenarios. 
In each raw directory, two subdirectories contain raw results for satisfiable and unsatisfiable
reconfiguration records

A sum up of the recorded times can be computed, running ` python analysis.py`.
